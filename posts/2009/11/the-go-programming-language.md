title: The Go Programming Language
---


Today I came across [a new programming language called
Go](http://golang.org/), developed by Google

It is meant to be fast, but still garbage collected and type safe. They
use pointers, but no pointer arithmetic.\
 The questions remains: Do we really need another C++-like language?

See Yourself:
