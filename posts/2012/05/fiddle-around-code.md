title: Fiddle around (code)
---


Since I’m using JavaScript more heavily, and beeing active on
[StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/549755/odi), I’m using a
service called [jsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/). It’s a great tool with
a simple idea (I can see a pattern here: great tools are always based on
simple ideas): Make it easy to write demo code. Either to help someone
or to point out a problem.

![jsFiddle UI](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4si0oEqzG1qa2z4q.png)

jsFiddle comes with a very basic user interface that is divided in 4
parts:

-   Basic HTML (omitting `<head>` and everything you don’t need)
-   CSS for styling
-   JavaScript (the heart of the page)
-   and finally the resulting page

No login required, just write your code and share the unique link. You
can even include JavaScript frameworks or other external resources, it’s
really easy!

Then last week I stumpled upon a website called
[sqlFiddle](http://sqlfiddle.com/), which uses the basic idea of
jsFiddle, but this time for databases and queries. There you can select
different database systems and start writing your SQL code.

Now today I learned about a site called [Sencha
Fiddle](http://www.senchafiddle.com/), that let’s you actually develop
[Sencha Touch](http://www.sencha.com/products/touch) mobile application.
You can even download the whole thing when your done. Wow!

There are several more xFiddle services that I can think of being
valuable:

-   LaTeX
-   Shell scripting (allowing me to choose which shell I want: csh, ksh,
    bash, ..)
-   Python
-   Sass/SCSS
-   Less
-   ..

I don’t know if there is a directory of these services (leave me a
message if you know it), but anyway I hope to see more websites like
that in the future.

Spread the word. Start to code.

**UPDATE I:** There is a [Python Fiddle](http://pythonfiddle.com/) :-)

**UPDATE II:** …and [Ruby Fiddle](http://rubyfiddle.com/) (thanks Jürg)

**UPDATE III:** [reFiddle](http://refiddle.com/) for regular expressions
(thanks [Toni
