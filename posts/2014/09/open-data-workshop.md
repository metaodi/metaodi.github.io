title: Workshop about Open Data Technologies
---

At todays [Opendata.ch Conference 2014](http://opendata.ch/2014) I had the opportunity to talk about technologies around the topic of open data.
I gave a quick overview over different approaches that are being used including [CKAN](http://ckan.org/), [The DataTank](http://thedatatank.com) and [Data Central](http://centraldedados.pt/).

On the technical side a talked about [(Tabular) Data Packages](http://data.okfn.org/standards) and a little bit about [JSON-LD](http://json-ld.org/).
Did you know, that [GMail is already using it](https://developers.google.com/gmail/actions/reference/formats/json-ld)?.

Here are my slides (German only, sorry!):

In the discussions that followed we talked about why we need Open Data portals (**conclusion: mainly for the PR**) and if
we prefer to wait until a data provider "cleaned" it's data or rather want it fast, so that the community can help to clean it up (**consensus: quick and dirty**).

For me, today was a really fun conferences. I met lots of new people, could catch up with already familiar ones and listen to a lot of great talks.

**Update:** Now the [videos of the conference](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLofS3lNZcksf4GROXzrAzSdXv7T10nGhX) have been published.
My session has not been recorded, but at the end I could quickly present our findings (again German only):
