title: Open Data MashUp @ Impact Hub
---

Last week I had the opportunity to talk at the [Impact Hub in Zurich about Open Data](https://zurich.impacthub.ch/event/mash-up/).
This event was part of a group of events in different locations of Impact Hub, called MashUp.

The talk was held in the [Pecha Kucha format](http://www.pechakucha.org/faq), which means you have 20 slides and 20 seconds for each slide.
Because of this _condensed_ form of giving a talk, there is not much space for text on the slides, rather images, graphics etc.
This is just a warning, as the slides without my talk might not be very useful.
Feel free to either fill the gaps yourself or contact me if you need more information or if you want to hear the talk again.
