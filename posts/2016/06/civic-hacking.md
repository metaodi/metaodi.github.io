title: Civic Hacking @ ImNeuland
---

At the ["Informatiktage 2016"](https://informatiktage.ch/) there were several events and I spoke at the [ImNeuland](http://imneuland.ch/) conference about _civic hacking_.
My talk was mainly about why I consider myself to be a civic hacker, why my curiosity drives me to explore things and how data can help us to explain the world.


Here are my slides:
