title: "Hacks/Hackers: Open Data Portals + Civic Hacking"
---

I was invited by the Hacks/Hackers meetup to give a talk about my passion "open data", so I decided to mashup my previous talks and talk about my work (building open data portals) and my private interest (being an open data activist and a civic hacker).
It was a very interesting experience and there were a lot of questions in the Q&A after my talk and even after then when we had some drinks at the venue.

Thank you to the organizers to having me and for everybody, who showed up!

As always, here are my slides:
