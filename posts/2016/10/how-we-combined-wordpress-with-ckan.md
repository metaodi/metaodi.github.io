title: "CKANCon 2016: How We Combined CKAN with WordPress"
---

This year the [CKANCon was in Madrid](https://ckan.org/ckancon-2016/), prior to the [International Open Data Conference](http://opendatacon.org/).
It was a one day, rather tech-focused, conference.
As CKAN is the framework I'm using almost on a daily basis, and I know a lot of people from the mailing list, it's good to meet them from time to time in person.

My talk was about the CKAN/WordPress integration we did for [opendata.swiss](https://opendata.swiss). You can find the slides below.

**Update**: In the meantime, all [CKAN and WordPress plugins were open sourced and can be found on GitHub](https://github.com/opendata-swiss)!
