title: "Jugend hackt Schweiz: Github & Git"
---

I was co-organizing "Jugend hackt" in Switzerland this year.
If you want more information about the event, read the [excellent blog post](https://jugendhackt.org/jugend-hackt-goes-international-ein-rueckblick/) about it, watch the [video of the final presentations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2lsOBaIm0U&list=PLQsLR7zBwcw1Tbzd0igtaC6HhMA_Lrmhq&index=11) or read the [article by SRF](http://www.srf.ch/news/panorama/jugend-hackt-zurueck-zu-den-wurzeln-der-hackathons) (including an audio interview with me :) ).

During the event there was also a series of lightning talks about a variety of topics.
I held a talk about "Github & Git", the slides are on [my github account](https://github.com/metaodi/git-talk) or [available online](http://metaodi.ch/git-talk) and they are actually a [fork of a similar talk](https://github.com/0x530302/git-talk/network) at a previous "Jugend hackt" event.
