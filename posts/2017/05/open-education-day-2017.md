title: "Open Education Day 2017: HTML/CSS Workshop"
---

The [/ch/open](https://www.ch-open.ch/) association hosted the [Open Education Day 2017](http://www.open-education-day.ch/) at the [FHNW in Brugg/Windisch](http://www.fhnw.ch/campus-brugg-windisch).

I wanted to provide a workshop that could possible be re-used in a classroom, as teachers were the main audience of this event.
As a coach of [OpenTechSchool](http://www.opentechschool.org/), it was clear that I would use one of those courses and talk a little bit about OTS as well.

After some thought, I chose the [HTML/CSS course](http://opentechschool.github.io/html-css-beginners/).
The course is designed to be "do it yourself, in your own tempo".

It was a lot of fun and I think the participants could take away the important message, that websites are not magic.
Thanks to the open learning material, they can finish the course on their own and also re-use it for their students.
