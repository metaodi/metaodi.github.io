I regularly speak at events and conferences or give workshops.
I'm a coach for <a href="http://www.opentechschool.org/zurich/">OpenTechSchool in Zurich</a> (education organization providing tech workshops and open learning materials).
In 2016 I started co-organizing <a href="https://jugendhackt.ch">"Jugend hackt" in Switzerland</a>, a hackathon for teenagers (<a href="http://www.srf.ch/news/panorama/jugend-hackt-zurueck-zu-den-wurzeln-der-hackathons">interview</a> & <a href="http://www.digitalbrainstorming.ch/de/multimedia/audio/jugendhackt">podcast</a> with me).

Below you can find my posts about my talks. They are usually about my main topic of interest: Open Data. I put most of <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/metaodi">my slides on SpeakerDeck</a>.

  <p>Together with <a href="http://www.karldergrosse.ch/">Zentrum Karl der Grosse</a>, the <a href="https://www.ccczh.ch/">Chaos Computer Club Zurich (CCCZH)</a> and the <a href="https://www.digitale-gesellschaft.ch/">Digitale Gessellschaft Schweiz</a> organized the <a href="http://www.karldergrosse.ch/veranstaltung/die-2-zuercher-dark-night/">2nd Dark Night in Zurich</a>.</p>

<p>I was asked to give a workshop about Open Data.
The audience was very broad, from young to old, from novice to tech-savvy, but they all had very little knowledge about Open Data.</p>

<p>It was a very good expierence to try to explain the field of my work and one of my biggest private interests from the ground up.</p>

<p>My approach was to break down this very complicated topic in 5 areas and I tried to encourage the participants to actually &quot;get their hands dirty&quot; by diving into an open data portal.
In the end, 60min is a very short time, but I hope I made a lasting impression and the topic of open data is no longer an &quot;unknown&quot; in their heads.</p>

If you want more information about the event, read the <a href="https://jugendhackt.org/jugend-hackt-goes-international-ein-rueckblick/">excellent blog post</a> about it, watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2lsOBaIm0U&amp;list=PLQsLR7zBwcw1Tbzd0igtaC6HhMA_Lrmhq&amp;index=11">video of the final presentations</a> or read the <a href="http://www.srf.ch/news/panorama/jugend-hackt-zurueck-zu-den-wurzeln-der-hackathons">article by SRF</a> (including an audio interview with me :) ).</p>

<p>During the event there was also a series of lightning talks about a variety of topics.
I held a talk about &quot;Github &amp; Git&quot;, the slides are on <a href="https://github.com/metaodi/git-talk">my github account</a> or <a href="http://metaodi.ch/git-talk">available online</a> and they are actually a <a href="https://github.com/0x530302/git-talk/network">fork of a similar talk</a> at a previous &quot;Jugend hackt&quot; event.</p>

  <p>This year the <a href="https://ckan.org/ckancon-2016/">CKANCon was in Madrid</a>, prior to the <a href="http://opendatacon.org/">International Open Data Conference</a>.
It was a one day, rather tech-focused, conference.
As CKAN is the framework I&#39;m using almost on a daily basis, and I know a lot of people from the mailing list, it&#39;s good to meet them from time to time in person.</p>

<p>My talk was about the CKAN/WordPress integration we did for <a href="https://opendata.swiss">opendata.swiss</a>. You can find the slides below.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: In the meantime, all <a href="https://github.com/opendata-swiss">CKAN and WordPress plugins were open sourced and can be found on GitHub</a>!</p>

  <p>I was invited by the Hacks/Hackers meetup to give a talk about my passion &quot;open data&quot;, so I decided to mashup my previous talks and talk about my work (building open data portals) and my private interest (being an open data activist and a civic hacker).
It was a very interesting experience and there were a lot of questions in the Q&amp;A after my talk and even after then when we had some drinks at the venue.</p>

<p>Thank you to the organizers to having me and for everybody, who showed up!</p>

<p>As always, here are my slides:</p>

My talk was mainly about why I consider myself to be a civic hacker, why my curiosity drives me to explore things and how data can help us to explain the world.</p>

  <p>Last week I had the opportunity to talk at the <a href="https://zurich.impacthub.ch/event/mash-up/">Impact Hub in Zurich about Open Data</a>.
This event was part of a group of events in different locations of Impact Hub, called MashUp.</p>

<p>The talk was held in the <a href="http://www.pechakucha.org/faq">Pecha Kucha format</a>, which means you have 20 slides and 20 seconds for each slide.
Because of this <em>condensed</em> form of giving a talk, there is not much space for text on the slides, rather images, graphics etc.
This is just a warning, as the slides without my talk might not be very useful.
Feel free to either fill the gaps yourself or contact me if you need more information or if you want to hear the talk again.</p>

  <p>Even though I&#39;m not an education expert, and I don&#39;t really have a professional background in didactics, I have some experience when I comes to teach people how to code, especially if they never wrote a single line of code before.</p>

<p>The topic of teaching accompanies me since some time now.
For one, the most obvious one, I&#39;m an apprentice trainer.
This means it&#39;s part of my job, to teach our young apprentices how to program.
But it doesn&#39;t stop there.
I&#39;m quite active on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/549755/odi">StackOverflow</a> (although one could argue this doesn&#39;t count as teaching).
Then last year, I got the chance to hold a <a href="http://www.jungejournalisten.ch/jugendmedientage/workshops-2/">workshop at the Jugendmedientage</a> to teach programming to young journalists, that never coded before.
All these experiences led me to believe that:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Programming can be learned</strong></li>
<li>It takes time, effort and patience for both the teacher and the student</li>
<li>Curiosity is the key</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/media/workshop.jpg" alt="Workshop at Jugendmedientage 2014"></p>

<p>I&#39;m writing about this topic, because not long ago we were discussing this topic at work.
One of our project managers said, she wants to learn at least a bit of programming, in order to understand what her team is doing.
Intuitively I disagreed.
I argued, that <strong>it&#39;s not the responsibility of a project manager to understand programming</strong>.
Everybody should focus on their main responsibilities and skills.</p>

<p>But then again:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wouldn&#39;t it be nice to have a <strong>common understanding of some basics</strong>?</li>
<li>It would be a tremendous help, if a PM could already decide if a problem is <em>hard</em> or <em>easy</em></li>
<li>Or if a PM understands some <em>technical terms</em> that get thrown around in the room all the time?</li>
<li>Why should anybody stop someone from learning something they are clearly interested in?</li>
</ul>

<p>But it&#39;s not just about PMs, and it&#39;s not just about my work place.
It&#39;s nice to be able to code.
To know, that this task, you&#39;ve been doing manually since so many years could be written in just a few lines of code.
Your life can get easier.</p>

<p>One of the projects I really like is <a href="http://www.opentechschool.org/">OpenTechSchool</a>.
It aims to create <a href="http://learn.opentechschool.org/">free online learning material</a> for everybody to learn about programming and related topics.
Apart from the docs, <a href="http://www.opentechschool.org/projects/workshops/">there are workshops</a>, free of charge, led by volunteers like me.</p>

<p>The goal of such workshops is not to become a <em>super-hero-programming-ninja</em>.
It&#39;s about <strong>understanding how a programmer tackles a problem, learn new skills and grasp some basic concepts</strong>.</p>

<p>Everbody can learn to code. If they want to. I&#39;m happy to help.</p>

  </ul>

  <p>At todays <a href="http://opendata.ch/2014">Opendata.ch Conference 2014</a> I had the opportunity to talk about technologies around the topic of open data.
I gave a quick overview over different approaches that are being used including <a href="http://ckan.org/">CKAN</a>, <a href="http://thedatatank.com">The DataTank</a> and <a href="http://centraldedados.pt/">Data Central</a>.</p>

<p>On the technical side a talked about <a href="http://data.okfn.org/standards">(Tabular) Data Packages</a> and a little bit about <a href="http://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a>.
Did you know, that <a href="https://developers.google.com/gmail/actions/reference/formats/json-ld">GMail is already using it</a>?.</p>

<p>Here are my slides (German only, sorry!):</p>

<iframe src="//slides.com/odi/opendatatech/embed" width="576" height="420" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

<hr>

<p>In the discussions that followed we talked about why we need Open Data portals (<strong>conclusion: mainly for the PR</strong>) and if
we prefer to wait until a data provider &quot;cleaned&quot; it&#39;s data or rather want it fast, so that the community can help to clean it up (<strong>consensus: quick and dirty</strong>).</p>

<p>For me, today was a really fun conferences. I met lots of new people, could catch up with already familiar ones and listen to a lot of great talks.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Now the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLofS3lNZcksf4GROXzrAzSdXv7T10nGhX">videos of the conference</a> have been published.
My session has not been recorded, but at the end I could quickly present our findings (again German only):</p>

      <a href="/tags#Talk-ref">Talk <span>10</span></a>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Some time ago the OKFestival asked for session proposals for this years conference in Berlin.
I was at the conference last year in Geneva and enjoyed very much.
It&#39;s just a nice atmosphere to talk to people from divers backgrounds (I&#39;ll get back to that in a minute).</p>

<p>Me and my colleagues from Liip thought about sessions for this years topic &quot;Open Minds to Open Action&quot;.
The <a href="http://2014.okfestival.org/programme/programme-faqs/">Programme FAQs</a> gave us some hints, what it takes for a session to be selected:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Does the proposal advance the overall <a href="http://2014.okfestival.org/programme/narrative-and-streams/">mission of the event</a></li>
<li>Does the proposal offer participants a concrete, valuable outcome?</li>
<li>Does the proposal advance the conversation around its area of open?</li>
<li>Is the proposal interactive? – <em>hint: slides and lectures strongly discouraged</em></li>
<li>Does the proposal value or build on OKFestival’s principles of inclusivity and diversity?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="toc_0">Help newbies at the conference</h3>

<p>We asked ourselves, how we can help people to connect to each other?
We pictured a person that is interesting in the &quot;Open Knowledge&quot; topic but doesn&#39;t know any people at the conference.
The first step is always the hardest.
How do you find people that are interested in the same topics?
Of course, one can attend sessions and try to talk to the people there.</p>

<p>But sometimes a little extra help is required.
Some conference solve this problem by providing some kind of buddy system (e.g. the <a href="http://events.ccc.de/2013/11/25/chaospatinnen/">Chaos Mentors at the 30C3</a>).
The buddies are volunteers that show newbies around, and show them the venue, introduce them to people and so on.
This is great for large conferences but <em>might</em> be an overkill for smaller ones.</p>

<p>As we were brainstorming about this we came up with the concept of a place, where everybody is encourages to write down his/her questions, so that others can pick that up and answer them right away or provide guidance.
We first thought about doing this online using something like a twitter hashtag.
But in the end, this is now why you went to a conference.
You want to meet real people to talk face-to-face.</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">Q&amp;A Wall to the rescue</h3>

<p>So the challange is just, to find these people.
To help making this asychronous, we developed the idea of a <strong>physical Q&amp;A wall</strong>.
This wall will be at the venue and provides space to write down questions (think of sticky notes or whiteboards to directly write on).
Like that, this wall provides a meeting point or to simply read and write questions.</p>

<p>I&#39;m very interested in how this wall is being used.
Maybe Q&amp;A is not the only thing that could be done with it.
Everybody is invited to use that space.
There are similar approaches to use such walls or boards to share news in local communities (<a href="http://candychang.com/community-chalkboards/">&quot;Community Chalkboards&quot;</a>).</p>

<p>Btw: the Q&amp;A Wall is also listed as a <a href="http://sched.co/1tx3TIy">session at the OKFestival</a>!</p>
